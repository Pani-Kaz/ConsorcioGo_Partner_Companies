# ConsórcioGo Partner Companies Marquee

This component displays a continuous marquee with logos from partner consortium companies supported by ConsórcioGo.

## Purpose

ConsórcioGo provides calculation engines and proposal simulations based on consortium products from multiple administrators.  
The companies shown in this component represent providers whose plans and rules are used in the platform's financial calculations.

The marquee visually communicates credibility and reinforces that the simulations are grounded in real consortium providers.

## Companies represented

- Servopa Consórcios
- Embracon
- HS Consórcios
- Volkswagen Consórcio
- Serello

## Usage

This HTML/CSS snippet can be embedded into landing pages, proposal pages, or institutional sections of the ConsórcioGo platform.

It creates a horizontal scrolling animation of partner logos:
- Infinite loop animation
- Pauses on hover
- Neutral visual treatment for consistent branding

## Notes

- Logos are loaded directly from official sources.
- The animation logic is purely CSS-based.
- No JavaScript is required.
